# Java

# Collections
Any group of individual objects that are represented as a single unit is known as a Java Collection of Objects.

‚ÄúCollection Framework‚Äù has been defined in JDK 1.2 which holds all the Java Collection Classes and Interface in it.

# AbstractCollection 
The AbstractCollection class in Java is a part of the Java Collection Framework and implements the Collection interface.

It is used to implement an unmodifiable collection, for which one needs to only extend this AbstractCollection Class and implement only the iterator and the size methods.

# AbstractSequentialList
The AbstractSequentialList class in Java is a part of the Java Collection Framework and implements the Collection interface and the AbstractCollection class(AbstractList Class).

# AbstractSequentialList methods:
1. size() -> used to get the size for this instance [arr.size()].
2. conatinsAll() -> used to check whether two Collections contain the same elements or not [abs.containsAll(abs2)].
3. lastIndexOf() ->  used to return the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in this list, or -1 if this list does not contain the element 
[arrlist.lastIndexOf(E)].
4. hashCode() -> used to get the hashCode value for this instance of the AbstractSequentialList[arr.hashCode()].
5. retainAll() ->  used to retain from this list all of its elements that are contained in the specified collection[arrlist1.retainAll(arrlist2)].
6. subList() ->  used to get a view of the portion of this list between the specified fromIndex, inclusive, and toIndex, exclusive. (If fromIndex and toIndex are equal, the returned list is empty.) The returned list is backed by this list, so non-structural changes in the returned list are reflected in this list, and vice-versa. The returned list supports all of the optional list operations supported by this list[sublist(int start, int end)].
7. toArray() ->  used to form an array of the same elements as that of the AbstractSequentialList [Object[] arr = AbstractSequentialList.toArray()].
8. toArray(T[]) ->  It returns an array containing all of the elements in this AbstractSequentialList in the correct order; the run-time type of the returned array is that of the specified array[abs_col.toArray(arr)].
9. contains() ->  used to check whether an element is present in a Collection or not[abs.contains(E)].
10. toString() ->  used to return a string representation of the elements of the Collection[abs.toString()].
11. clear() -> used to remove all the elements from a list[arr.clear()].
12. indexOf() -> used to return the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in this list, or -1 if this list does not contain the element[arrlist.indexOf(E)].
13. set() -> used to replace any particular element in the list created using the AbstractSequentialList class with another element[list.set(index, E)].
14. removeAll() -> used to remove from this list all of its elements that are contained in the specified collection[arrlist1.removeAll(arrlist2)].
15. isEmpty() -> used to check whether this AbstractSequentialList is empty or not[arr.isEmpty()].
16. equals() -> used to check if this AbstractSequentialList object is equal to the object passed as the parameter[arrlist1.equals(arrlist2)].
17. get() -> used to fetch or retrieve an element at a specific index from a AbstractSequentialList[list.get(index)].
18. remove() -> used to remove an element from an abstract sequential list from a specific position or index[remove(index)].
19. addAll() -> used to append all of the elements from the collection passed as a parameter to this function at a specific index or position of a abstract sequential list[addAll(index, C)].


# ArrayList

It is a part of collections framework (class of java.util). we don‚Äôt need to mention the size when creating ArrayList. It automatically adjusts its capacity as elements are added or removed.
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e9deba2-c94d-4035-b0a9-10166f6ff307)

Syntax of ArrayList : ArrayList<type> arr = new ArrayList<type>();

1. AbstractList: This class is used to implement an unmodifiable list, for which one needs to only extend this AbstractList Class and implement only the get() and the size() methods.
2. CopyOnWriteArrayList: This class implements the list interface. It is an enhanced version of ArrayList in which all the modifications(add, set, remove, etc.) are implemented by making a fresh copy of the list.
3. AbstractSequentialList: : This class implements the Collection interface and the AbstractCollection class. This class is used to implement an unmodifiable list(linkedlist), for which one needs to only extend this AbstractList Class and implement only the get() and the size() methods.

> üí° ArrayList is not synchronized. Use Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>()) for thread-safe operations.

> üí° ArrayList can store null elements.

> üí° ArrayList can store data till the ArrayList size is full, after that the size of ArrayList is doubled if we want to store any more elements.

# Vector Class

The Vector class implements a growable array of objects.

<img width="203" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b87273a-030b-43f6-8a45-a0495c332ae9" />



If the increment is specified, Vector will expand according to it in each allocation cycle. Still, if the increment is not specified, then the vector‚Äôs capacity gets doubled in each allocation cycle. Vector defines three protected data members:

int capacityIncrement: Contains the increment value.

int elementCount: Number of elements currently in vector stored in it.

Object elementData[]: Array that holds the vector is stored in it.


Vector throws errors :
1. IllegalArgumentException if the InitialSize of the vector defined is negative.
2. NullPointerException if the specified collection is null.

# Constructors
1. Vector(): Creates a default vector of the initial capacity is 10.
Vector<E> v = new Vector<E>();

2. Vector(int size): Creates a vector whose initial capacity is specified by size.
Vector<E> v = new Vector<E>(int size);

3. Vector(int size, int incr): Creates a vector whose initial capacity is specified by size and increment is specified by incr. It specifies the number of elements to allocate each time a vector is resized upward.
Vector<E> v = new Vector<E>(int size, int incr);

4. Vector(Collection c): Creates a vector that contains the elements of collection c.
Vector<E> v = new Vector<E>(Collection c);

# Operations
1. Adding elements :
  * add(Object): This method is used to add an element at the end of the Vector.
  * add(int index, Object): This method is used to add an element at a specific index in the Vector.
2. Updating Elements :
  * set(int index, Object): this method takes an index and the updated element to be inserted at that index.
3. Removing elements :
  * remove(Object): This method is used to remove an object from the Vector. If there are multiple such objects, then the first occurrence of the object is removed.
  * remove(int index): Since a Vector is indexed, this method takes an integer value which simply removes the element present at that specific index in the Vector. After removing the element, all the elements are moved to the left to fill the space and the indices of the objects are updated.
4. Iterating over elements :
  *  get(int index): to get the element at a specific index.

 **Advantages**
Thread-Safe: All methods are synchronized, making it suitable for multi-threaded environments. However, this can lead to performance overhead in single-threaded scenarios.

Allows Nulls: Can store null elements.

Enumeration Support: Provides backward compatibility with Enumeration, a legacy way of iterating over elements.

**Disadvantages**
It gives a poor performance in adding, searching, deleting, and updating its elements.

The Iterators returned by the Vector class are fail-fast. In the case of concurrent modification, it fails and throws the ConcurrentModificationException.
